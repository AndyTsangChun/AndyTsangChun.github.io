                                <h2>My Mottos, 3 Life-time Qoutes</h2>
                                <p>Everyone loves qoutes.</p>
                                <p>No matter you're feeling sorrowful or tried. An inspirational qoute always helps people to feel relieved from or related to their current situation. The right qoute can activates an emotional pulse point in our hearts and minds when we are in a distressing situation. It's kinda like having someone speaking out the exact same thought for you from your mind.</p>
                                <p>But for me, it works way more than just an emotional support. There's a few qoute which speaks the motto of my life, and I wanted to share them here.
                                </p>
                                <div class="qoute-bg">
                                    <blockquote>Pursue excellence, and success will follow.</blockquote>
                                    <cite>3 Idiots</cite>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <p>This is a qoute said by Rancho from a famous Indian movie - 3 Idiots. First of all, I don't think I had OCD or either a perfectionist. But I do always seek for getting or delivering the best I can, or at least meeting some sort of standard. 
                            </p>
                            <p>When this extend to my life, we know that everyone wants to be successful. More typically in Hong Kong right now, success kinda equals to how wealthy you are. Sometimes, "being wealthy" even becomes one of the most heartbreaking joke in this city as a major spouse condition. Of course, like everyone else I wanted to be successful but... eventually.
                            </p>
                            <p>What I meant here is, money is essential but not the only thing we should aim for. It's a typical phenomenon in Asian society that <b>"youngsters were raised to provide against old age"</b>, many of us has a lot of financial pressure from family or society. Although in Hong Kong, we had a saying that <b>"If you don't have a dream, you are no different than a salted fish."</b>. However, the brutal turth here is I witnessed countless of people giving up their dream for a job they never like. Not saying that it's not happening in other places, I knew over 50% of people are having a job they don't like in worldwide, but its just more likely to happen here.</p>
                            <p>
                            So what am I trying to say here is, I do think I'm one of the lucky ones. My parents are not really wealthy, but at least I don't really had much finacial pressure from them, and I'm really really grateful about it. That's why, I see myself, as one of those given the opportunities to follow my dream. Tho, not sure how long I can stay on this path. But just for the record, I wish to stay as long as I can. sAs long as I am still on the path, I will try be excellent while not for the rich. Cause I deeply believe, you don't had to think how to be successful or rich, just think about how to be excellent on the task you are working on, then, evetually success will follow you.
                            </p>
                            <div class="qoute-bg">
                                <blockquote>Never too late, or not such thing as catching up.</blockquote>
                                <cite>Unknown</cite>
                            </div>
                            <p>There's plenty of version with different phasing of this qoute, but I like it in this way. This qoute kinda sum up my life on my early 20s. I'm always not afraided to shared my past, cause our past don't define who we are, but our past is what made who we are. It's something that we should always aware and learn from it. When I was around 20, I failed all my exam in A-Level, and that's why I had to use my CE result to apply for IVE. At that time, due to the society environment I was once ashamed to be an IVE student, because most of my friends entered those top university in Hong Kong or at least doing some more reputed Higher Diploma Course.</p>
                            <p>It's true that, you really can't examine a fish to climb a tree. It also doesn't matters where you study but how. During those three years in IVE, I finally found my strength on Computing. And that's how I get my scholarship from Alistair Harvey Foundation and continue my study in UK. Which further helped me to develop my career into the AI industry.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            I started my university study 3 years later than all of my friends, I started to study AI on my own for one year after my graduations and I started to work couple years later than my peer. Yet, there will always be a way out. There's still a long kong path for me, but I will catch up eventually.</p>

                            <p> It's NEVER TOO LATE.</p>

                                <blockquote>I'd rather regret the things I've done than regret the things I haven't done.</blockquote>

                            The last qoute here, this one is much more straight forward. It's another thing I learnt during my 3 years in IVE. Basically, this qoute just to remind myself to keep jumping out of the comfort zone.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            I was once told by someone, I didn't enjoy much of my life during teenage, I didn't try enough crazy stuff. For sure, there's a lot stuff I should really try, but there's always a list of things I wouldn't bother to try. My adivce here is, try as much as you can while keeping you NOT TODO LIST tight to yourself, don't just follow the trend.
                            </p>
                            <h2>Other inspiring qoute</h2>
                            <p>
                            These are just some other good qoute I saw. I won't say they are my motto like the others, but it's just some ideas I believe under certain situations.
                            </p>
