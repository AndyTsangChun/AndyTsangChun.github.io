                                <p> <b>Human Is</b> is a short science fiction written by Philip K. Dick  published in Startling Stories, 1955. The story centers on a woman (Jill) suffering in a loveless marriage, who then found her emotionally abusive husband suddenly appears to be a different man after his return from battle. In fact, he was literally a different "man", whom disguised by an alien, where her real husband the real Lester was already dead in the battle. However, in the end although Jill knows the man wasn't her original husband, she still denies to help the Federal Clearance agency to convict "Lester". She believes that he is the "real husband" she has been seeking for years.</p>

                                <p>So... how was this story related to AI? Let me explain in a sec.</p>

                                <p>First of all, what people think AI is? AI (Artificial Intelligence) was first coined by John McCarthy for an academic conference in 1956 Dartmouth. Its meant to be understanding and further simulate the human intelligence with machines. In much simpler terms, it means how can a machine think like human. To verify it father of AI, Alan Turing proposed a test called "Turing Test" to examine the machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior, which becomes one the foundation of AI nowadays. The test simply requires an Evalutor(A) to distinguish between Human(B) and Machine(C) when both were given a same task.</p>

                                <p>Thoughout the latest half century, numerous researcher and scientist has been working on solving this question. We have been through the winter of AI during 80s~90s and finally the sun shines again since 2012, when Alex Krizhevsky et al. brought the first benchmark neural network architecture up to the ground. Of course, there're countless pioneer researcher like Andrew Ng, Geoffrey Hinton, Yann LeCun, Lee Fei Fei and her team on ImageNet contributed to this up raise, but I can't list all of them here, maybe there will be another article on the <b>History of AI</b>. So back to the point, </p>

                                - What is the meaning of AI? 
                                - What is the current state of AI? 
                                - How should future of AI look like?

                                <p>Dick commented about this story: <b>"It’s not what you look like, or what planet you were born on. It’s how kind you are. They quality of kindness, to me, distinguishes us from rocks and sticks and metal, and will forever, whatever shape we take, wherever we go, whatever we become."</b></p>
